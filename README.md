# Blockchain Final Year Project
### ABSTRACT:

Many sectors, including finance, medicine, manufacturing, and education, leverage blockchain applications for their unique characteristics. Blockchain technology (BT) offers benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency. This project explores the application of blockchain in open science, showcasing its potential as an infrastructure. The focus is on secure transactions using blockchain for financial transactions between friends. The project is implemented in Python.

Blockchain serves as an unalterable digital ledger distributed across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains transactions, and any new transaction updates every participant's ledger. The core elements of a block include data, a nonce (a randomly generated 32-bit number), and a hash (a 256-bit number linked to the nonce). The hash must start with numerous zeroes, ensuring security.
